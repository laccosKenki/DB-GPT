# What is HYDRUS 2D/3D and How to Use It in 14 Days
  
HYDRUS 2D/3D is a powerful software package for simulating water, heat, and solute transport in variably saturated porous media. It can be used to model a wide range of applications, such as irrigation, drainage, infiltration, evaporation, plant water uptake, soil erosion, slope stability, groundwater recharge, contaminant transport, and more. HYDRUS 2D/3D is based on the finite element method and can handle complex geometries and heterogeneous soils with an arbitrary degree of anisotropy. HYDRUS 2D/3D also includes several add-on modules that extend its capabilities for specific problems.

If you are interested in learning how to use HYDRUS 2D/3D for your research or engineering projects, this article will guide you through the basic steps to get started in 14 days. You will learn how to:
  
- Install and activate HYDRUS 2D/3D on your computer
- Create and edit a project using the graphical user interface (GUI)
- Define the geometry, mesh, materials, boundary conditions, initial conditions, and observation nodes of your model
- Select and configure the flow and transport options and parameters
- Run the simulation and view the results
- Perform sensitivity analysis and calibration using inverse modeling tools
- Explore some advanced features and add-on modules of HYDRUS 2D/3D

By following this article, you will be able to set up and run your own HYDRUS 2D/3D models in a short time and gain confidence in using this versatile software. You will also find links to useful resources, such as tutorials, examples, manuals, forums, and support services that will help you further improve your skills and knowledge of HYDRUS 2D/3D.
  
## Day 1: Install and Activate HYDRUS 2D/3D
  
The first step to use HYDRUS 2D/3D is to install it on your computer. You can download the latest version of HYDRUS 2D/3D from the official website of PC-PROGRESS[^1^], the developer of the software. You can choose between a 32-bit or a 64-bit version depending on your operating system. The 64-bit version can handle larger models with more finite elements than the 32-bit version.
  
To install HYDRUS 2D/3D, you need to have administrator rights on your computer. You also need to have Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 or higher installed on your computer. The installation process is straightforward and takes only a few minutes. You just need to follow the instructions on the screen and accept the license agreement.
  
After installing HYDRUS 2D/3D, you need to activate it with a license key. You can obtain a license key by purchasing a license from PC-PROGRESS or one of its distributors[^1^]. You can also request a free demo version that allows you to use HYDRUS 2D/3D for one month with some limitations[^1^]. To activate HYDRUS 2D/3D, you need to run the program as an administrator and enter your license key in the activation dialog box. You can activate HYDRUS 2D/3D online or offline depending on your internet connection.
  
## Day 2: Create and Edit a Project Using the GUI
  
The next step to use HYDRUS 2D/3D is to create a project using the graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI is a user-friendly tool that allows you to define all the aspects of your model in a visual way. You can access the GUI by running HYDRUS 2D/3D from the Start menu or by double-clicking on its icon on your desktop.
  
The GUI consists of several windows that display different information and options for your project. The main window shows the geometry of your model domain and allows you to zoom in and out, rotate, pan, and select elements. The left panel
